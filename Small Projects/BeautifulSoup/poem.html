<h1>"In the Absence of You"</h1>

<p>In the quiet depths of longing's hue,<br />
A poem blooms, as I'm missing you.<br />
Through empty spaces, my heart does roam,<br />
Seeking solace in memories of home.<br>
<br />
Your laughter echoes within my soul,<br />
A melody that I yearn to behold. <br />
The touch of your hand, the warmth of your embrace, <br />
I yearn for the moments we used to chase.<br>
<br />
Days pass by like fleeting whispers in the wind, <br />
While I'm left here, longing to rescind <br />
The distance that separates our beating hearts, <br />
Yearning for the closeness that love imparts.<br />
 <br />
The world seems dimmer, colors less bright, <br />
In the absence of you, my guiding light. <br />
Every step I take feels incomplete,<br />
For your presence, my soul continues to entreat. <br />
<br />
Yet, in the midst of this ache and despair,<br />
I find solace knowing you still care.<br />
For even when apart, our love remains,<br />
Bound by an unbreakable, invisible chain.<br />
<br />
Until the day when we're reunited once more,<br />
I'll hold your memory close, to the core.<br />
And through the empty spaces that divide,<br />
I'll keep missing you, with love as my guide.<br />
</p>
